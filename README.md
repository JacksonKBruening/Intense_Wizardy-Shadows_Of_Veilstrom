# Intense_Wizardy-Shadows_Of_Veilstrom
ASP.NET Razor Page for a personal C# Adventure game



An ASP.NET Razor page using C#, HTML, and CSS to create a site that displays the information from JSON Files for Intense Wizardy:Shadows of Veilstorm. 
Intense Wizardy:Shadows of Veilstorm is a C# based text adventure style game that I am working on as a personal project in my free time.
This is a work in progress, and will be updated frequently.

Current Goals:
-Finish Home Page full with graphics and buttons redirecting to every page.
-Upgrade the CSS code for every page.
-Upgrade the Characters, and Backstory pages.
-add a Locations Page

Future Goals List:
-Integrate trial portions of the game to the website.


Thanks,
